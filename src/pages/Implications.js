            <h2>What do students find reliable?</h2>
            <p> 
              Some findings of our study are straightforward: Students find visuals (pictures, graphs, and videos)
              reliable and are hyper-aware of advertisements and web design features of sources (Silva, Green, &amp;
              Walker, 2018). Fewer, however, are able to dig deeper and articulate why certain design choices have
              the effect they have, and what that might suggest about the information source.  
            </p>
            <p> 
              The trickier finding of our study is that students find authority important while evaluating a source, but
              there is little agreement about what authority actually means. What makes something authoritative or
              not? How do we define authority and who gets to decide? What parts of an article speak to authority?
              When different parts of an article have competing authority claims, which ones are more or less
              important? Given their difficulty rating sources it might seem that students did not understand the
              importance of authority. However, we contend that our students clearly understood that authority was
              a significant component of source evaluation. They knew they should look for authority markers, but
              they struggled to know how sources were created clearly enough to put their finger on what might
              make them authoritative to a particular audience, for a particular research task.
            </p>
            <p>
              This finding is both unsurprising but also very difficult to confront. In an era of teaching students pithy
              rules of thumb about source evaluation, we have told students that authority matters, but we have not
              sufficiently unpacked how complicated authority markers are. For example, one test that librarians have
              utilized is the CRAAP test (currency, relevance, authority, accuracy, purpose). These criteria are fairly
              straightforward to teach, but do little to confront the complicated authority markers on the web. While
              each criterion is a subset of authority, teaching blanket truths about something as contextual as
              authority unduly simplifies the issue. Indeed, compositionist Jonathan Ostenson (2014) has asked us to
              move away from these kinds of rules of thumb, but teaching the CRAAP test is still ubiquitous in high
              school and university information literacy pedagogy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, the students’ misunderstanding of information types, like the inability to evaluate
              mainstream media any differently than fringe media, showcases a naiveite about how online
              publications are written, edited, and for what reason these publications exist. And while some
              immaturity is to be expected of students at this level, the amount of time our students spend online
              begs for better instruction on how to evaluate online source material.        
            </p>
            
            <h2>Changing Praxis</h2>
            <p>
              As librarians who partner with the first-year writing course on our campus, we have had to think about
              how source evaluation instruction might change based on the findings of this study. We recognize that
              many librarians feel deeply conflicted about what to teach in library sessions because we generally only
              have students for a short period of time. For some of us, we might only have one shot to teach
              everything we need to teach. Historically we’ve used this time for point and click instruction, instruction
              that is more task-oriented and less concept-oriented. In other words, our instruction has been very
              skills-based and not metacognitively oriented (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011, p.62) To truly change the way
              librarians teach about source evaluation would be to incorporate them into the curriculum more
              integrally from the beginning—something that not all library staff are prepared to do given budget and
              personnel constraints. We are a far cry from the first scholars to suggest such an approach. Indeed,
              Artman, Frisicaro-Pawlowski, and Monge (2010) argue that such a collaborative approach will improve the
              transferability of information literacy competencies for first-year students (105).
            </p>
            <p>
              In our praxis at BYU, we have set aside about thirty minutes to teach about source evaluation, and have
              radically shifted from teaching general rules of thumb (accuracy, authority, relevance, currency) to more
              contextualized instruction about what to look for in different publication types. Instead of suggesting a
              few markers that can be used in all source evaluation contexts, we instead teach that the context should
              dictate how the source is evaluated. This helps students move beyond shallow markers of credibility like
              simply looking at the website design to asking what design means about credibility. It helps students
              enact more sophisticated fact-checking behaviors like corroborating information or finding out who
              created the information at hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, we focus on teaching the difference between evaluating academic sources and popular
                sources and focus on lateral reading strategies when talking about online, open source material. This
                comes directly from Sam Wineburg’s (2017) work through the Stanford History Education Group, where
                researchers found that advanced fact checkers spend little time on a website itself (reading vertically up
                and down the page), but rather, fact checkers got off of the website to check its credibility through
                Google searches and other methods, on average opening up seven tabs in the first few seconds of
                evaluating a source.     
            </p>
            <p>
              These strategies do not come naturally to students, especially if they have the inclination to assess a
              website’s visual presence for markers of authority rather than leaving the site to figure out who created
              it and what bias the author/publishing body might have. In discussions with our research team in the
              library we have come to the conclusion that if information literacy concepts are to be taught effectively
              in the classroom, librarians (especially in the way they are traditionally incorporated into composition
              courses) may not be the ones best equipped to teach it. That is not because we are not qualified, but
              rather, because the composition teachers are the ones with the strongest ethos and extended face time
              with student researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, thirty minutes, no matter how well spent, cannot teach all of the ways in which source
              evaluative behaviors might take place in a research process. In some ways, training the English teachers
              to think a little bit more like librarians might be the best way to teach source evaluation to writing
              students.
            </p>

            <h2>Pedagogical Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
              To restate: composition teachers may be best able to reach student researchers with information
              literacy skills to help with source evaluation. Though the principles we offer here are targeted for
              composition instructors, there are certainly many instructional contexts in which you might apply these
              principles. Our suggestions are based on the major findings of our study, especially in the issues we
              observed in novice student comments.
            </p>
            <h2>1. How does information come to be?</h2>
            <p>
              Students struggled understanding the differences between fringe and mainstream news media outlets.
              They exhibited distrust of the media in general with little understanding of how different kinds of
              information are created and how that affects the value of the information. The Framework for
              Information Literacy for Higher Education, the document that outlines major competencies for
              information literacy standards, puts it this way: “The unique capabilities and constraints of each creation
              process as well as the specific information need determine how the product is used. Experts recognize
              that information creations are valued differently in different contexts, such as academia or the
              workplace. Elements that affect or reflect on the creation, such as a pre- or post-publication editing or
              reviewing process, may be indicators of quality.” (ACRL, 2015, “Information Creation as a Process”
              frame, para. 2). Showing students examples of different sources and unpacking the ways they were
              created, may help students grasp this concept in their research processes (Ostenson & Silva, 2019).
            </p>
            <h2>2. Authority is contextual</h2>
            <p>
              Given the fact that many composition courses also include elements of rhetorical theory, extending such
              discussions to how authority functions in information contexts could be helpful. In our study students
              struggled to understand and articulate what makes sources authoritative. We believe this has to do with
              students’ confusion over why different sources might be consulted depending on different research
              tasks. While there are traditional markers of authority that carry from one source type to another
              (venue quality, author’s credentials), much of what would help a student choose one source over
              another is what their audience would consider authoritative and persuasive. As the Association of
              College and Research Libraries’ Framework (2015) puts it: “Information resources reflect their creators’
              expertise and credibility, and are evaluated based on the information need and the context in which the
              information will be used. Authority is constructed in that various communities may recognize different
              types of authority. It is contextual in that the information need may help to determine the level of
              authority required” (“Authority is Constructed and Contextual” frame, para. 1). Extending discussions of
              authority from analyzing texts within their rhetorical contexts to analyzing sources within their research
              contexts may help students understand this principle. Indeed, as Andrea Baer (2018) argues, moving
              away from the good/bad dichotomy within information evaluation discussions will help students situate
              information within its contextual ecosystem and become more sophisticated information users (p. 72).
            </p>
            <h2>3. Check your bias</h2>
            <p>
              While unsurprising, confirmation bias was something that students relied on strongly to decide whether
              information was credible or not. Writing teachers may be able to help students create a more open
              posture when searching, or at least help students understand how their pre-conceived notions on a
              subject might shut them off from learning. Furthermore, discussions on intellectual silos and echo
              chambers are helpful to aid students in seeing how the information environments in which they live
              affect their beliefs. Mike Caulfield, media professor, and Director of Blended Network Learning at
              Washington State University in Vancouver, writes in Web Literacy for Student Fact-Checkers (2017) that
              in addition to developing good fact-checking habits, we must always check ourselves. He cautions,
              “When you feel strong emotion–happiness, anger, pride, vindication–and that emotion pushes you to
              share a ‘fact’ with others, STOP. Above all, these are the claims that you must fact-check. Why? Because
              you’re already likely to check things you know are important to get right, and you’re predisposed to
              analyze things that put you [in] an intellectual frame of mind. But things that make you angry or
              overjoyed, well… our record as humans are not good with these things” (Building a Fact-Checking Habit
              by Checking Your Emotions section, para. 3-4). While librarians may be able to start discussions about
              bias, it’s unlikely that in 30 or 50 minutes, or even in one to two class periods, we would be able to
              revisit the issue in enough depth to help students confront their own beliefs and question their own
              biases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given the extent of our study, the nearly 100 hours of recorded research behavior and 500 pages of
              transcriptions we coded, our observations both corroborate previous discussions on source evaluation
              in composition classes and complicate those findings. We find much to be hopeful for. Students seem to
              have impulses in assessing information sources productively, but lack the context and instruction to help
              them successfully place themselves within information ecosystems. Indeed, many of us that fall on the
              more expert side of the spectrum also struggle with our own biases and issues of trust. For instance,
              throughout this article we have consistently discussed the Washington Post as a reputable source because 
              of our previous experience with that source, and, perhaps, our own biases regarding the kind of journalism
              we have grown to trust. However, the Washington Post also publishes humor and opinion editorials. If we teach
              students that the Washington Post is always trustworthy, students will struggle when they come across alternative genres in that venue.
              Instead, we should teach students to consider their biases, including previous experience, and help them realize when the venue's 
              reputation coincides with other markers of authority as well (like relevant evidence, 
              links to corroborating sources, prior work on the same subject by authors, neutral tone, etc.). In this example, the publication venue
              is a shortcut, but not a substitute, for various authority markers. Checking bias can help students, and ourselves,
              make sure we are looking for all of these markers and weighing them within the information's context.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, we believe that first-year writing courses can help with such media and information literacy
              challenges by focusing on teaching information creation patterns, contextual authority, and bias-
              checking. These are places where further research with writing students and first-year students at large
              could uncover practical pedagogical interventions to make a difference in students’ critical literacy skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Indeed, if our current moment has taught us anything, it is that with the ever-changing information
              engine that is the web, we are all of us re-learning how to evaluate information. Part of showing
              students how to be better evaluators of information is to reflect on our own information consumption
              and usage, and ask ourselves how we came to be the experts we are? Coronavirus has shown us all our
              blind spots as fear and confusion have overtaken our information patterns. Perhaps starting with
              personal reflection will better ground us to be more thoughtful information literacy instructors for our
              first-year students.
