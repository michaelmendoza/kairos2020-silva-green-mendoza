            Given the quickly changing ecosystem of information online, studies like ours will continually need to be
            revisited in the light of shifting evaluative impulses on the part of students. While significant literature
            exists about source evaluation behaviors which we review in the context portion of this webtext, the
            timeliness of our study, the demographics studied, and the methods of our data collection gives our
            study a rich overview of first-year writing student evaluation behaviors that can help us decide how to
            better teach about interacting with web-based information in composition classes. Here, we over view
            some of the major findings of the study. First, we begin with the basic demographic breakdown of our
            participants.

            In our grounded theory coding, we took note of what students wrote were the most and least reliable
            features of each article. Here is our summary of most and least reliable features for each article studied.
